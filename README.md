# About the Project
Adventour – Tourist Website
This was my first web development project, created during my second year of college. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the GSAP is a framework-agnostic animation library. I developed this project as part of a college competition, where I scored 49 out of 50 marks.

Working on Adventour gave me valuable hands-on experience, especially in designing responsive and visually appealing layouts using CSS. This project marked the beginning of my journey into web development and helped strengthen my interest in frontend technologies.
